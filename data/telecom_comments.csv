1KOIMJIU1s4,@nanakwamebaafi1,VGMA you're full of it and acting like dumb heads. Why should your personal differences affects the nominations. It shows how useless and unprofessional the Ghana Music award is. Do you think the BET or the Grammy will be too emotional and wouldn't nominate an artiste just because there are differences? Your personal differences shouldn't affect Shatta Wale's nomination or any artiste that disagrees with the award company. ,2017-05-18T01:01:40Z,0
